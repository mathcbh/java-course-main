= Access databases from Eclipse
:toc: preamble
:sectanchors:

This document briefly explains how to access SQL databases from Eclipse. We illustrate with a PostgreSQL DB, then with a Derby database hosted in a GlassFish server.

NOTE: The reader supposedly has basic knowledge of JDBC and Eclipse.

== Configure access to DB

* First, you need a JDBC driver, that Eclipse will use to access your DB. See https://jdbc.postgresql.org/[here] for PostgreSQL, or find the one you need for your DB type. [small]#(or `sudo apt-get install https://packages.debian.org/stable/libpostgresql-jdbc-java[libpostgresql-jdbc-java]`)#
* Within Eclipse: `Preferences / Data Management / Connectivity / Driver Definitions`
* Register there your driver for PostgreSQL (or the DB type you need)
** This does _not_ create a connexion: it only declares a new driver definition, that is, a _kind_ of connexion (that you will use in the next step)
** Eclipse asks that you start with a template. Eclipse uses it to provide particular features for your DB type. (Unfortunately, JDBC is not a good enough abstraction and Eclipse has to know which flavor of SQL and protocol your DB implements.)
** Choose the Eclipse template version that is the highest possible, but lower than or equal to your JDBC driver version (https://stackoverflow.com/a/39304224[SO])
* From the `Data Source Explorer` view, create a connexion to your DB (using the driver definition created previously)
* You can now view and edit data from the `Data Source Explorer` view
* You can write and send SQL commands from the `SQL Scrapbook` (with completion!)
