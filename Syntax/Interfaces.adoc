= Syntax for interfaces

A Java interface declares methods, but does not define them. It has no behavior. (Except for default methods, a recent addition to Java that we will not discuss in detail.) Classes can _implement_ interfaces. When a class implements an interface, it indicate that it can be manipulated using the methods declared in the interface.

The following example indicates that anything that satisfies the `Robot` interface can be moved, can give its current position (as an integer), and can accelerate. But it does not say how any of this is done, internally.

[source, java]
----
public interface Robot {
  public void move(int steps);
  
  public int getPosition();
  
  public void accelerate();
}
----

Here is an example of a class implementing this interface.

[source, java]
----
public class FastRobot implements Robot {
  private int currentSpeed;
  
  private int currentPosition;
  
  @Override
  public void move(int steps) {
    currentPosition += steps * currentSpeed;
  }
  
  @Override
  public int getPosition() {
    return currentPosition;
  }
  
  @Override
  public void accelerate() {
    currentSpeed *= 2;
  }
}
