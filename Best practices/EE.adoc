Best practices about Java EE

== Maven and Java EE

When working with a Java EE 7 server, you might want to include this dependency, to get all Java EE 7 specs at once.

.The whole Java EE 7 specification as a dependency in your `pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>javax</groupId>
	<artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
	<version>7.0</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Be cautious however. This (unfortunately) includes directly https://www.javadoc.io/doc/javax/javaee-api/7.0/index.html[many classes] which also are available as separate packages. And sometimes those classes are older versions that those provided by recent packages. Hence, you might end up with different classes in your class path that have the exact same name. And problems might follow.

For example, https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22javax%22%20AND%20a%3A%22javaee-api%22[`javax:javaee-api`] includes a version of https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html[`javax.ws.rs.core.Response`] that does not implement `AutoCloseable`. Your project might also depend on https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22javax.ws.rs%22%20AND%20a%3A%22javax.ws.rs-api%22[`javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api:2.1`], in which case you also have a https://javadoc.io/doc/javax.ws.rs/javax.ws.rs-api/2.1/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html[version] of that class that implements `AutoCloseable`. A similar problem exists for `javax.json.JsonValue`.

If your dependency graph is subtle so that you risk to run into such issues, you might prefer to selectively depend on the exact specifications you need. Looking at the https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=javax/javaee-api/8.0/javaee-api-8.0.pom[Java EE 8 POM] (and https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=javax/javaee-web-api/8.0/javaee-web-api-8.0.pom[Java EE Web 8 POM]) may help for this.
