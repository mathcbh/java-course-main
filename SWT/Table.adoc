= SWT Table widget
:sectanchors:

This document present various possibilities of using SWT table widget and JFace table helpers.

== Raw Table widget

“Raw” https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Table.html[Table] widgets (that is, without using JFace additions to it) work as follows. You add `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/TableItem.html[TableItem]` s to it (one per line); and `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/TableColumn.html[TableColumn]` s (one per, well, column). You set text on the table items by column index using `setText(int, String)`. You need to manually keep the table items synced to your model. You may insert and remove table items by index.

To support edition, add `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/custom/TableEditor.html[TableEditor]` s to cells in the table. A table editor has a cell editor control (of type control and not `CellEditor`) and is bound to a cell in the table (actually, to a table item and a column). The cell editor control appears on top of (that is, instead of) the normal cell of the table. You need to register manually for events to detect when the user has validated some new input, and update your model accordingly. You probably also need to manually toggle between the normal table view and the table editor view. For example, if a specific column requires a combo box for edition, you probably want to display a combo box only when the focus is on a cell in that column, and otherwise just display a string with no combo box.

== JFace TableViewer

You may want to use a JFace `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TableViewer.html[TableViewer]` to ease the management of a `Table` widget. A `TableViewer` is a sort of JFace viewer. (JFace also offers viewers for lists or other widgets.)

=== JFace viewers

A JFace viewer wraps some SWT widget. Apart from its wrapped widget, you need to provide it with:

* an `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/IContentProvider.html[IContentProvider]`, able to transform an input element into content elements,
* an `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ILabelProvider.html[ILabelProvider]`, able to transform a content element to a label,
* (optionally) a viewer sorter, which sorts content elements.

You then set the input element of the viewer. Typically, this is a collection of things, where a thing is some object of your creation. The content provider in the viewer will then transform this input element (the collection of things) into content elements (that is, a list of things). The viewer is thus said to have a list of content elements. Make sure you understand the distinction between the _input_ element, that typically represents a set of objects (it is typically a collection), but is considered by the viewer content provider as a single object, and the _content_ elements, that the viewer has a list of.

=== Overview of table viewer

A JFace table viewer is a sort of viewer. More precisely, it is a sort of column viewer (a viewer that can display informations by column). A table viewer wraps an SWT table widget, and has:

* an `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/IStructuredContentProvider.html[IStructuredContentProvider]` (which extends `IContentProvider`),
* specialized kinds of `ILabelProvider` that transform content elements into sets of labels (see below),
* may have `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TableViewerColumn.html[TableViewerColumn]` s: a sort of `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerColumn.html[ViewerColumn]`, each of them has a label provider, which use CellLabelProvider, and editing support, which use CellEditor,
* alternatively (older API), may have a set of column “properties” (strings that designate columns), one per columns, together with an `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ICellModifier.html[ICellModifier]` and one `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/CellEditor.html[CellEditor]` per column.
//* Check also: `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ColumnViewerEditor.html[ColumnViewerEditor]`.

=== Label providers for table viewer

If you provide a simple `ILabelProvider` (that is not an `ITableLabelProvider` nor a `CellLabelProvider`) to a table viewer, it will be used to provide a label only for the first column. Rather use one of the more specialized label providers for table viewers.

* An `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ITableLabelProvider.html[ITableLabelProvider]` provides separate labels text for each column.
* A `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/CellLabelProvider.html[CellLabelProvider]` has more control over what’s shown to the user: instead of merely providing a label when asked for (as with `ITableLabelProvider`), it is responsible for updating whole viewer cells. It can thus, for example, manage the font of the related cell. Override the `update` method and use its `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerCell.html[ViewerCell]` parameter to query for the current element and column index to be updated.
* A `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ColumnLabelProvider.html[ColumnLabelProvider]` extends `CellLabelProvider`. It has the extended flexibility of `CellLabelProvider` but also provides simplified specification of a text or other parameters of a label (such as a font or a background), given a content element. Just override the method corresponding to your needs.

=== Cell editors

Cell editors may be of kind `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TextCellEditor.html[TextCellEditor]`, `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ComboBoxCellEditor.html[ComboBoxCellEditor]`, … In all cases, you create the editor giving it its parent table as parameter. Editors have a value, taken from the cell modifier, when edition starts. They also send a value to the cell modifier when user has finished edition. The type of those values depend on the editor: text cell editors work with string values, combo box cell editors work with zero-based index of the selected item as values, …

=== Using table viewer columns in a table viewer

I recommend to use the more flexible and more recent API that involves table column viewers. This way you deal with your table logic one column at a time. You add table column viewers to your JFace table viewer (one per column of your underlying table widget). For each column viewer you set a label provider. To support edition in that column, use an `https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/EditingSupport.html[EditingSupport]` object. You override this class and provide the kind of cell editor you want. (An EditingSupport object plays the role of an ICellModifier in the older API, but for a given column.)

=== Edition in a table viewer with column properties, a cell modifier and cell editors

As an alternative way of supporting edition, use a cell modifier. It uses column properties, text strings that identifies columns and that also are set on the viewer itself.
